|Create a website that contains a homepage that links to other pages with recipes|

    Using what I learned through the HTML intro of The Odin Project I will be demonstrating the use of

        Create directories and .html files through the Terminal
        Create an HTML burnerplate
        Use Anchor tags to link to different web pages
        Use headers level 1-6 and paragraph tags
        Use organized list tags and unorganized list tags
        Insert images using img, href, and alt tags
        Add and Commit with messages through the Terminal to Git
