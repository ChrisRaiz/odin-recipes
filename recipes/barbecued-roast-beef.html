    <!-- Steps list -->
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix salt, sugar, pepper, and cayenne for dry rub together and coat beef well on both sides.</li>
        <li>Place on a rack set on a sheet pan and refrigerate, uncovered, for 12 to 24 hours, flipping over halfway through.</li>
        <li>Mix barbecue sauce, vinegar, mustard, turmeric, and garlic together for wet rub and reserve.</li>
        <li>Transfer beef to a dish and pour 1/2 of the wet rub over top. Use two forks to poke the surface all over for about 1 minute. Turn beef over and repeat with remaining wet rub. Spoon any excess on the bottom over the top.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate for 4 to 12 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat a charcoal grill until the briquettes turn white and ashy. Remove meat from the refrigerator, uncover, and scrape off excess wet rub.</li>
        <li>Grill over hot charcoal until blackened and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meat reads 120 to 125 degrees F (49 to 52 degrees C), 7 to 10 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. Remove to a foil-lined plate, and quickly wrap up tightly in foil.</li>
        <li>Let rest for at least 15 minutes, during which time the meat will finish cooking, and end up close to medium-rare.</li>
        <li>Slice very thinly, toss in the meat drippings and juices left in the foil, and serve on buns.</li>
    </ol>
